            <p>This Chocolate Magic Cake is an incredible easy cake to make. 
                One simple thin batter, bake it and you end up with a 3 layer 
                chocolate magic cake</p>
            <p>A few years ago my Magic Cake recipe took over the internet. 
                Ever since then I’ve made many different versions, 
                including this chocolate magic cake version. 
                If I were to pick a favorite, I’d say it’s a tie between this 
                and Nutella magic cake!</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Eggs – You’ll need 4 eggs at room temperature, separated.</li>
                <li>Milk – I like to warm up the milk a bit so the butter doesn’t 
                    cool in the batter, just to about 95F. I’ve made this cake 
                    with lactose free milk as well as 2% milk</li>
                <li>Vinegar – We need a bit of white vinegar when whisking the 
                    egg whites, to prevent over-beating. A small amount helps 
                    to stabilize the egg whites and allows them to reach full 
                    volume and stiffness.</li>
                <li>Flour – All purpose flour is what works best for this cake.
                     Other readers have used gluten free flour, some with great 
                     success, some without.</li>
                <li>Cocoa Powder – This is what makes our magic cake chocolatey.</li>
                <li>Butter – I like to use unsalted butter, but if you only have 
                    salted butter, use that and you can omit the salt.</li>
                <li>Salt – Without salt, your cake would be bland.</li>
                <li>Sugar – Add a bit of sweetness to your cake. Granulated 
                    sugar is fine.</li>
                <li>Vanilla Extract – As with salt, vanilla extract brings all 
                    the flavors together in this cake.</li>                      
            </ul>

            <h3>How To Make Chocolate Magic Cake</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Prep: Preheat oven to 325°F. Line a 8×8 inch baking dish with 
                    parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Mix the yolks with water and sugar: Separate the eggs and 
                    add the egg yolks to the bowl of a mixer. Add a tbsp of water 
                    and the sugar. Beat this at high speed until are eggs are 
                    light and pale in color.</li>
                <li>Drizzle in melted butter, vanilla and add salt: Add melted 
                    butter, vanilla extract and salt to the yolk mixture and 
                    continue beating until butter is fully incorporated and the 
                    mixture is light.</li>
                <li>Stir in the dry ingredients: Add the flour and cocoa powder 
                    to the bowl and mix thoroughly, scraping down the side and 
                    bottom of the bowl as needed.</li>
                <li>Add milk: Add the milk a bit at a time and mix. The milk 
                    should be warm so not to cool the butter. Make sure the milk 
                    has been mixed in thoroughly. The mixture should be pretty wet, 
                    so don’t get scared.</li>
                <li>Whisk the egg whites: If using a handheld mixer, clean the 
                    beaters and pour the egg whites in a large clean bowl. 
                    If using a stand mixer, wash the mixing bowl and whisk 
                    attachment and make sure you dry them out. Add egg whites 
                    to mixing bowl and the vinegar and mix until egg whites are 
                    stiff.</li>
                <li>Add the egg whites to cake batter: Add a bit of the egg whites 
                    to the chocolate mixture and gently mix using a whisk. Next 
                    you’re going to reverse and add a bit of the chocolate mixture 
                    to the egg whites. This way it will be easier to mix 
                    everything together. Repeat until everything is mixed 
                    together and the mixture should be quite thin. Make sure 
                    to leave a distinct layer of fluffy egg white lumps at the 
                    top of the batter, so do not overmix.</li>
                <li>Bake, chill and serve: Pour the batter in the prepared baking 
                    dish and bake for roughly 60 minutes or until done. The cake 
                    will still jiggle in the middle when you take it out, so that’s 
                    normal. Let it cool completely, chill for about 4 hours 
                    letting the cake set, then cut into squares and serve.</li>
