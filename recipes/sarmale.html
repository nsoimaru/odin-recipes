            <p>This recipe for Romanian cabbage rolls is tried and true. 
                I’ve made it probably a hundred times, and have rolled thousands 
                of them! The big difference between Romanian cabbage rolls 
                and others are that we make them with sour cabbage. 
                You can find sour cabbage at pretty much all grocery 
                stores sold in jars. You can also find sour cabbage at your local 
                Polish or Ukrainian stores!</p>
            <p>This is my mom’s recipe and it’s my favorite. 
                I won’t eat cabbage rolls made any other way. 
                The other piece that separates Romanian cabbage rolls from the r
                est is that we add some kind of smoked meat. This time I used 
                smoked bacon. Now I’ve got your attention, hey?</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Vegetable oil – We’ll be using this to saute the onion and rice. 
                    You can use any type of oil that you have handy.</li>
                <li>Onion – I used a large onion because this recipe makes a lot 
                    of cabbage rolls. Every bite should have onion in it!</li>
                <li>Long grain rice – Basmati rice is best. I wouldn’t use brown 
                    rice- it takes a lot longer to cook than white rice and you 
                    may end up with crunchy bits in your rolls.</li>
                <li>Ground pork – I love to use pork because it has a higher fat 
                    content and makes for some nice juicy rolls. You can use any 
                    type of ground meat you like, but keep in mind that leaner 
                    meats like chicken or turkey will come out drier.</li>
                <li>Fresh parsley & dill – Using fresh herbs makes such a big 
                    difference in how the flavor develops in your rolls!</li>
                <li>Salt & pepper – Season the mixture to your own discretion.</li>
                <li>Sour cabbage leaves – This is what really sets the Romanian 
                    version apart from the rest. The little hit of vinegar 
                    is to die for!</li>
                <li>Bacon – Find yourself a nice thick-cut smoky style of bacon.</li>
                <li>Tomato juice – This is what our rolls are going to sit and 
                    cook in.</li>

            <h3>How to Make Romanian Cabbage Rolls</h3>
            <p>This recipe is super easy to prepare. The hardest part is getting 
                through rolling all of that filling, but I promise it’s worth it. 
                Make a day of it and invite some friends and family to help!</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Prepare the filling: Heat the oil in a skillet over 
                    medium-high. Saute the onions until translucent, then add 
                    the rice and toast for 1 minute. Add the pork, salt, pepper, 
                    parsley, dill, and the onion mixture to a large bowl 
                    and mix well. Use salt sparingly – the cabbage leaves are 
                    brined.</li>
                <li>Roll the filling: Remove the cabbage leaves from the brine. 
                    You can soak them in water beforehand to draw out some of 
                    the salt. Cut each leaf in half and fill the piece with a 
                    few tbsp of the meat mixture and roll. Refer to the video in 
                    the recipe card to see how I roll these nice and tight. 
                    Repeat until all the filling has been used.</li>
                <li>Assemble the rolls: Chop up the remaining cabbage leaves and 
                    add them to a large pot or deep roasting dish with a lid. 
                    Arrange all the rolls over the chopped cabbage and disperse 
                    the bacon evenly among the rolls. Pour the tomato juice over 
                    the rolls and top up with some water, if needed, to ensure the 
                    rolls are covered with liquid.</li>
                <li>Bake the rolls: Cover the pot with a lid or foil. Bake at 
                    375F for 2 hours, then remove the cover and cook for another 
                    1 1/2 – 2 hours. Serve hot with a side of sour cream.</li>
